Human-pose-estimation
There are few things which we need on our system :
1. Python Installation (Version 3.6 or above):
Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. The code is compatible with Python version 3.6 or above.

2. OpenCV and Matplotlib Installation:
To install the OpenCV and Matplotlib Installation library, run the following command in your terminal: 
• Copy the code: “pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib”

3.Jupyter Notebook:Ensure that you have Jupyter installed.

Steps to execute the project:

•	Open the project link.
•	Click on the "Code" button next to the "Add file" button.
•	Select HTTPS and copy the URL.
•	Open the folder where you want to run the project.
•	Right-click and open the terminal.
•	Type "git clone" and then paste the URL.
•	Press enter.
•	Open the " Human-pose-estimation" folder.
•	Open the terminal in this folder.
•	Type the "jupyter notebook" command and press enter.
•	Select and open the “ speech.ipynb” Jupyter file.


Steps to Run Human Pose Estimation Program:

•	Open Jupyter Notebook environment.
•	Navigate to the directory where the "pose_estimation.ipynb" file is located.
•	Click on the "pose_estimation.ipynb" file to open it within Jupyter Notebook.
•	Execute the cells in the notebook by either clicking on the "Run" button or pressing "Shift + Enter" while the cell is selected.
•	After running the script, the program will capture video frames from your webcam for pose estimation.
•	It will perform pose estimation on each frame using the pre-trained deep learning model loaded from "graph_opt.pb".
•	Annotated frames with skeletal connections representing human poses will be displayed in real-time within the Jupyter Notebook interface.
•	To exit the program and terminate its execution, follow the predefined key press instructions within the code (e.g., press 'p').
•	Clean up resources by releasing the video capture object and closing OpenCV windows after program termination.
